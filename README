This is the "Yet Another Modbus" library, or libyam. It is a Modbus/RTU master
library, using termios to access a serial device. It can issue Modbus/RTU
command packets, and interpret the results.

The packets are formed according to the documentation available at the Modbus
IDA website.

http://www.Modbus-IDA.org

Currently, the following types of packets are allowed:
Read Multiple Registers
Read Multiple Inputs
Write Single Coil
Write Single Register
Read Exception Status
Write Multiple Coils
Write Multiple Registers
Report Slave ID

Note for 64-bit users
---------------------
libtool for 64-bit distros such as Fedora 14 that store 32 and 64 bit libraries
in /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 don't seem to "do the right thing" and choose /usr/lib64
even if --prefix to the configure script is set to /usr. The workaround is to
issue

./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64

This puts everything into the right place
